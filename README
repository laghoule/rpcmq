Requirement
------------

python
python-pika (not in Debian stable, but you can repackage: http://ftp.ca.debian.org/debian/pool/main/p/python-pika/)


Description
-----------

Send remote command to a server via AMQP bus. I used this to make some automation with AWS autoscaling and puppet.


Install
-------

Debian way: Just build the package with debuild
http://www.ducea.com/2008/03/06/howto-recompile-debian-packages/

To install the listening daemon: dpkg --install rpcmq-common rpcmq-server
To install the client: dpkg --install rpcmq-common rpcmq-client

PS: AMQPS is currently broken in pika library, should be available in next version (0.9.6)
